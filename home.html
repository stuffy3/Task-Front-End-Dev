			<p>
				Texas has a rich history that spans from its early indigenous inhabitants, 
				including the Caddo, Comanche, and Apache, to its time under Spanish and later 
				Mexican rule. After tensions between American settlers and the Mexican government, Texas fought for and won its independence in 1836, briefly existing as the Republic of Texas before joining the United States in 1845. The discovery of oil in 1901 transformed its economy, which had already been shaped by cattle ranching and agriculture. Today, Texas is the second-largest U.S. state, known for its diverse geography, booming industries in energy and technology, and major cities like Houston, Dallas, and Austin. Its blend of Native American, Spanish, Mexican, and American influences continues to shape its unique culture and identity.
